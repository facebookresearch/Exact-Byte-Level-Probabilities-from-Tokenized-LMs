"""
A Trie/Prefix Tree is a kind of search tree used to provide quick lookup
of words/patterns in a set of words. A basic Trie however has O(n^2) space complexity
making it impractical in practice. It however provides O(max(search_string, length of
longest word)) lookup time making it an optimal approach when space is not an issue.
